## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. I have:

* Corrected the 'Undefined global functions or variables'

* Written 'curve length' instead of 'curvelength'

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.2
* Ubuntu 14.4, R 3.2.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
    Maintainer: ‘Shahin Tavakoli <s.tavakoli@statslab.cam.ac.uk>’
    New submission

    I believe this is normal because this is a new submission
